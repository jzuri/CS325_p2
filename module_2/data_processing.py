#SOLID Principle - Single Responsibility Principle
#In this case, the data_processing file follows this principle by only handling one responsibility.
#The file is only responsible for hanlding data processing of the information and that is it.
#Splitting up the responsibilities makes sure that the data_processing file handles scraping the data, while the file_handling file reads the data and saves it to the proper file.

#Input:
#Code expects the input of a URL to be completed

#Output:
#If successful, output will be the scraped article
#If unsuccessful, output will be "Just go ahead and change your major =P"

#Working:
#Scrapes the article content from the provided URL using requests and BeautifulSoup
